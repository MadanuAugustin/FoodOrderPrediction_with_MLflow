## Predictive Modelling for Food Order Prediction

This project focuses on using Machine learning techniques to predict food order trends. Accurate prediction of food orders is crucial for optimizing inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing food waste. By employing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict food orders accurately based on relevant features such as order history, menu items, and customer preferences.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop reliable prediction models that accurately forecast food orders. These models will assist restaurants and food delivery services in optimizing their inventory and preparation processes, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset containing relevant attributes such as order history, menu items, and customer preferences. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Deep learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project include:
- RandomForestClassifier

### Evaluation:
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, f1-score, and precision. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the models' reliability and applicability across different order conditions.
